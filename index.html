          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Communication is a learnable skill. This book walks you through the main ingredients: eye contact, body language, gestures, appearance, tone, intonation, pacing, pronunciation, listening, and confidence. Use the sidebar to jump to any chapter and the videos to deepen your practice.</p>

      <section id="eye-contact" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 1</p>
        <h2>Eye Contact</h2>
        <p>Eye contact builds trust and shows you're engaged. Hold it naturally for a few seconds, then briefly look away to avoid staring. In groups, sweep your gaze across the room so everyone feels included. Too little can seem evasive; too much can feel intense.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain 50–70% eye contact when speaking or listening.</li>
          <li>Look at the bridge of the nose or between the eyes if direct eye contact feels uncomfortable.</li>
          <li>In presentations, pause on different sections of the audience rather than fixing on one spot.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Use eye contact to build trust and show engagement. Aim for 50–70% contact, look away briefly to avoid staring, and in groups spread your gaze so everyone feels included. In presentations, move your focus across different parts of the audience.</p>

        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 2</p>
        <h2>Body Language</h2>
        <p>Your posture and movements send messages before you speak. Open posture (uncrossed arms, relaxed shoulders) signals approachability. Leaning slightly forward shows interest; mirroring the other person subtly can build rapport.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stand or sit with shoulders back and spine straight.</li>
          <li>Avoid crossing arms in defensive or closed positions.</li>
          <li>Face the person or audience directly when possible.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Body language sets the tone before you say a word. Use open posture, face people directly, and avoid closed or defensive poses. Small shifts in how you stand and move can increase both your confidence and others’ trust in you.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="hands-gestures" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 3</p>
        <h2>Hands & Gestures</h2>
        <p>Hands reinforce your words when used purposefully. Natural gestures—emphasizing a point, showing size or direction—make your message clearer. Avoid fidgeting, pocket-hands, or repetitive motions that distract.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use gestures at chest to shoulder height; keep them in the "gesture zone."</li>
          <li>Match gesture size to the space: smaller in one-on-one, broader in large rooms.</li>
          <li>Let your hands rest naturally when not gesturing—at your sides or lightly on a surface.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Use your hands to support your message: gesture in the chest-to-shoulder zone, scale gestures to the setting, and avoid fidgeting or hiding hands in pockets. Natural, purposeful gestures make your communication clearer and more engaging.</p>

      <section id="dressing" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 4</p>
        <h2>Dressing & Appearance</h2>
        <p>How you dress affects first impressions and how seriously you're taken. Match your attire to the context: formal for interviews and key meetings, smart-casual for most professional settings. Neat, clean, and appropriate clothing signals respect and preparedness.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dress slightly above the expected level for the situation when in doubt.</li>
          <li>Ensure clothes are clean, pressed, and well-fitted.</li>
          <li>Minimize distractions: avoid loud patterns or accessories that draw attention away from your message.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="video-embed">

        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Dress for the context: when in doubt, err on the side of slightly more formal. Keep clothes clean, well-fitted, and low-distraction so your message stays the focus and you signal respect and readiness.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="tone" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 5</p>
        <h2>Tone of Voice</h2>
        <p>Tone conveys emotion and intent. A warm, steady tone builds connection; a flat or harsh tone can create distance. Adjust your tone to the message—calm for difficult topics, energetic for ideas you want to inspire with.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Speak with warmth and clarity; avoid monotone.</li>
          <li>Match your tone to the content: serious when needed, lighter when appropriate.</li>
          <li>Breathe from your diaphragm for a fuller, more confident sound.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="video-embed">

        </div>
        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Tone carries emotion and intent. Use a warm, clear tone to connect; avoid monotone or harshness. Match your tone to the situation—calm when it’s serious, more energy when you want to inspire—and support your voice with steady breathing.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="intonation" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 6</p>
        <h2>Intonation</h2>
        <p>Intonation is the rise and fall of your voice. It shapes meaning—questions often rise at the end; statements fall. Varying pitch keeps listeners engaged and helps highlight key points. Monotone delivery can make even important content sound dull.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Raise pitch slightly for questions or to show curiosity.</li>
          <li>Lower pitch to signal certainty or the end of a thought.</li>
          <li>Use variation to emphasize important words or phrases.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Intonation is the melody of your speech. Vary pitch: rise slightly for questions and curiosity, lower for certainty and closure. Use variation to stress important ideas and keep your audience engaged instead of sounding flat.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="pause" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 7</p>
        <h2>Pause & Pacing</h2>
        <p>Pauses give your audience time to process and add weight to your words. Rushing suggests nervousness; strategic pauses create emphasis and control. Slow down for key ideas and after questions to invite reflection.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pause after important points so they land.</li>
          <li>Use a slightly slower pace when explaining complex ideas.</li>
          <li>Silence is okay—don't fill every gap with "um" or "like."</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="video-embed">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcGyVTAoXEU" title="How to Speak So That People Want to Listen — pace and pause" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        </div>
        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Use pauses to let ideas land and to sound calmer. Pause after key points, slow down for complex content, and avoid filling silence with fillers. Good pacing shows confidence and helps listeners follow you.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="pronunciation" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 8</p>
        <h2>Pronunciation</h2>
        <p>Clear pronunciation helps your message be understood. Articulate consonants, open vowels, and avoid mumbling. If you have an accent, slow down slightly on critical terms. Practice tricky words in advance for presentations.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Enunciate the ends of words; avoid dropping syllables.</li>
          <li>Practice difficult or technical terms before speaking.</li>
          <li>Ask for feedback if others often ask you to repeat yourself.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="chapter-summary">
          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Pronunciation supports clarity. Articulate clearly, especially word endings; practice hard or technical words beforehand; and slow down on key terms if needed. Ask for feedback if people often ask you to repeat yourself.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="listening" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 9</p>
        <h2>Active Listening</h2>
        <p>Communication is two-way. Active listening means fully focusing on the speaker, withholding judgment, and responding thoughtfully. Nodding, brief verbal acknowledgments, and paraphrasing show you're engaged and help avoid misunderstandings.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Give full attention; put devices away and avoid planning your reply while they speak.</li>
          <li>Summarize or paraphrase to confirm understanding.</li>
          <li>Ask open-ended questions to deepen the conversation.</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Chapter Summary</h3>
          <p>Active listening makes communication two-way. Focus fully on the speaker, put devices away, and resist planning your reply while they talk. Paraphrase to check understanding and use open-ended questions to go deeper.</p>
        </div>

      <section id="confidence" class="chapter">
        <p class="chapter-label">Chapter 10</p>
        <h2>Confidence</h2>
        <p>Confidence comes from preparation and practice. Know your material, rehearse key moments, and focus on the value you're offering. Stand tall, breathe, and speak at a steady pace. Confidence is contagious and makes your message more persuasive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Prepare so you know your main points by heart.</li>
          <li>Use positive self-talk and visualization before important conversations.</li>
          <li>Accept that small mistakes are normal; recover and continue.</li>
        </ul>
